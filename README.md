## Welcome to Yash's "All About Me" Page!

  Hey everyone! I am extremely delighted to be presented with the oppurtunity to build a website through my school's Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles class to give the world a little taste of who I am and what I am all about! 

# Who Am I?

  My name is Yash Zumale and I am fifteen years old, an American born Indian, I come from a family of four (my father, mother, and sister...it's her birthday today!!), and I attend Whitney High School as a sophomore and Sophomore President.

## What Am I About?

  I am all about about enjoying every single second of life and I do so by pursuing my many passions. It truly seems as if I am passionate about everything in life, however, some of things that I am really passionate about include learning, sports, reading, being in the outdoors, anything related to the beach, and SCIENCE!

  Here is a little fun fact about myself that I think you all might enjoy, I was voted as Class Clown in eight grade! As you might assume, I really enjoy laughing and making others laugh as well. I truly believe that laughter is the best medicince, espcially when your freinds, family, and other loved ones laugh with you. Feel free to check out why laughter is the best medicine through the link below.
