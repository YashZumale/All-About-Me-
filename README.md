## Welcome to Yash's "All About Me" Page!

  Hey everyone! I am extremely delighted to be presented with the oppurtunity to build a website through my school's Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles class to give the world a little taste of who I am and what I am all about! 

### Who Am I?

  My name is Yash Zumale and I am fifteen years old, an American born Indian, I come from a family of four (my father, mother, and sister...it's her birthday today!!), and I attend Whitney High School as a sophomore and Sophomore President.

### What Am I About?

  I am all about about enjoying every single second of life and I do so by pursuing my many passions. It truly seems as if I am passionate about everything in life, however, some of things that I am really passionate about include learning, sports, reading, being in the outdoors, anything related to the beach, and SCIENCE!

^The image above represents my love for science. I especially love the fields of astronomy, marine biology, psychology, and computer science!

  Adding on, here is a little fun fact about myself that I think you all might enjoy, I was voted as Class Clown in eight grade! As you might assume, I really enjoy laughing and making others laugh as well. I truly believe that laughter is the best medicince, espcially when your freinds, family, and other loved ones laugh with you.

  Also, I really love to play and watch sports. I personally find all sports fun to play, but my favorites are surfing, bodyboarding, swimming, inline skating, cross country, basketball, tennis, badminton, and track. In additon to physical games, I also love to play video games such as Minecraft, Fortnite, Call of Duty, GTA, Among Us, Minion Rush, and Angry Birds.
  
  That's it for my "All About Me" page. I hope you got to know me better!
